## 2021 EV Racecar Software 
Welcome to UCI's Anteater racing software page. This is where all of the embedded software work is done for our EV racecar. 

### Components
Central Control Module (CCM), 
Suspension Sensor Array (SSA)

The CCM is the main microcontroller for the car. It works as the central hub for anything the car does. Some of its functionalities
include taking in car based inputs (steering, brake, throttle), controlling the motors, and grabbing data from the SSA.
The SSA acts as the data acquisition component for our racecar.
