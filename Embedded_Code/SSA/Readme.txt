Data acquisition module for Ampeater v1. Integrates 3 IR sensors, 1 IMU, and a hall effect sensor.
IR sensors are used for reading tire temperatures. The tire is measured at three different points; the inside,
middle, and outside. The IMU is used to measure acceleration and gyro data. And the hall effect sensor is used
with 2 magnets to estimate tire speed.
